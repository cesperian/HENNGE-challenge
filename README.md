About; 2020 HENNGE tech challenge

Finished project hosted [here](https://cesperian.github.io/HENNGE-challenge/dist/search.html).

## CHALLENGE DETAILS

Suppose we have a system which archives emails of an organization. In the event of security incidents
(such as leakage of sensitive information via emails), this system will be used by the organization's
auditing department to retrieve and verify the emails of the concerning parties through its admin
console. We would like you to build the user interface (UI) mockup for this system.


###Mission 1: Create the UI

Assignment: Using the images below, create the UI mockup using HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. based on the design. You can use any framework or just vanilla JS to build this mockup.

###Mission 2: Extend the UI in order to implement a new feature

Assignment: In the search result section, extend the UI mockup so that user can inspect the body of each email from the search result.
